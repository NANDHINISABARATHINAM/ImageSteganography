# ImageSteganography
This explains about how to hide text inside an image. The secret information is hidden in a way that it not visible to the human eyes.


The word steganography means” covered in hidden writing”. The object of steganography is 
to send a message through some innocuous carrier (to a receiver while preventing anyone else 
from knowing that a message is being sent to all).
